ich-ai-to-use-in-the

I have written eight of these guides since ChatGPT came out, but this versi=
on represents a very large break with the past, because what it means to =
=E2=80=9Cuse AI=E2=80=9D has changed dramatically. Until a few months ago, =
for the vast majority of people, =E2=80=9Cusing AI=E2=80=9D meant talking t=
o a chatbot in a back-and-forth conversation. But over the past few months,=
 it has become practical to use AI as an agent: you can assign them to a ta=
sk and they do them, using tools as appropriate. Because of this change, yo=
u have to consider three things when deciding what AI to use: Models, Apps,=
 and Harnesses.
Models are the underlying AI brains, and the big three are GPT-5.2/5.3, Cla=
ude Opus 4.6, and Gemini 3 Pro (the companies are releasing new models much=
 more rapidly than the past, so version numbers may change in the coming we=
eks). These are what determine how smart the system is, how well it reasons=
, how good it is at writing or coding or analyzing a spreadsheet, and how w=
ell it can see images or create them. Models are what the benchmarks measur=
e and what the AI companies race to improve. When people say =E2=80=9CClaud=
e is better at writing=E2=80=9D or =E2=80=9CChatGPT is better at math,=E2=
=80=9D they=E2=80=99re talking about models.
Apps are the products you actually use to talk to a model, and which let mo=
dels do real work for you. The most common app is the website for each of t=
hese models: chatgpt.com, claude.ai, gemini.google.com (or else their equiv=
alent application on your phone). Increasingly, there are other apps made b=
y each of these AI companies as well, including coding tools like OpenAI Co=
dex or Claude Code, [ https://substack.com/redirect/9c3d4b93-365b-41a5-b387=
-47b16288fa32?j=3DeyJ1IjoiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujHigXfWySh5Pw-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7=
mo2IM ] and desktop tools like Claude Cowork.=20
Harnesses are what let the power of AI models do real work, like a horse ha=
rness takes the raw power of the horse and lets it pull a cart or plow. A h=
arness is a system that lets the AI use tools, take actions, and complete m=
ulti-step tasks on its own. Apps come with a harness. Claude on the website=
 has a harness that lets Claude 4.6 Opus do web searches and write code but=
 also has instructions about how to approach various problems like creating=
 spreadsheets or doing graphic design work. Claude Code has an even more ex=
tensive harness: it gives Claude 4.6 Opus a virtual computer, a web browser=
, a code terminal, and the ability to string these together to actually do =
stuff like researching, building, and testing your new website from scratch=
=2E Manus (recently acquired by Meta) w=
as essentially a standalone harness th=
at could wrap around multiple models. OpenClaw, which made big news recentl=
y, is mostly a harness that allows you to use any AI model locally on your =
computer.=20
Until recently, you didn=E2=80=99t have to know this. The model was the pro=
duct, the app was the website, and the harness was minimal. You typed, it r=
esponded, you typed again. Now the same model can behave very differently d=
epending on what harness it=E2=80=99s operating in. Claude Opus 4.6 talking=
 to you in a chat window is a very different experience from Claude Opus 4.=
6 operating inside Claude Code, autonomously writing and testing software f=
or hours at a stretch. GPT-5.2 answering a question is a very different exp=
erience from GPT-5.2 Thinking navigating websites and building you a slide =
deck.
It means that the question =E2=80=9Cwhich AI should I use?=E2=80=9D has got=
ten harder to answer, because the answer now depends on what you=E2=80=99re=
 trying to do with it. So let me walk through the landscape.
The Models Right Now
The top models are remarkably close in overall capability and are generally=
 =E2=80=9Csmarter=E2=80=9D and make fewer errors than ever. But, if you wan=
t to use an advanced AI seriously, you=E2=80=99ll need to pay at least $20 =
a month (though some areas of the world have alternate plans that charge le=
ss). Those $20 get you two things: a choice of which model to use and the a=
bility to use the more advanced frontier models and apps. I wish I could te=
ll you the free models currently available are as good as the paid models, =
but they are not. The free models are all optimized for chat, rather than a=
ccuracy, so they are very fast and often more fun to talk to, but much less=
 accurate and capable. Often, when someone posts an example of an AI doing =
something stupid, it is because they are either using the free models or be=
cause they have not selected a smarter model to work with.
The big three frontier models are Claude Opus 4.6  [ https://substack.com/r=
edirect/2c8c5c33-f480-431d-b866-0f5c45492298?j=3DeyJ1IjoiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujHi=
gXfWySh5Pw-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7mo2IM ]from Anthropic, Google=E2=80=99s Gemi=
ni 3.0 Pro [ https://substack.com/redirect/07205261-329b-403d-b7dd-94abc979=
90e3?j=3DeyJ1IjoiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujHigXfWySh5Pw-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7mo2IM ], =
and OpenAI=E2=80=99s ChatGPT 5.2 Thinking [ https://substack.com/redirect/1=
a1c59fb-6e15-4b1a-88a3-e0d8ae1f774f?j=3DeyJ1IjoiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujHigXfWySh5P=
w-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7mo2IM ]. With all of the options, you get access to t=
op-of-the-line AI models with a voice mode, the ability to see images and d=
ocuments, the ability to execute code, good mobile apps, and the ability to=
 create images and video (Claude lacks here, however). They all have differ=
ent personalities and strengths and weaknesses, but for most people, just s=
electing the one they like best will suffice. For now, the other companies =
in this space have fallen behind, whether in models or in apps and harnesse=
s, though some users may still have reasons for picking them.
When you are using any AI app (more on those shortly), including phone apps=
 or websites, the single most important thing you can do is pick the right =
model, which the AI companies do not make easy. If you are just chatting, t=
he default models are fine, if you want to do real work, they are not. For =
ChatGPT, no matter whether you use the free or pay version, the default mod=
el you are given is =E2=80=9CChatGPT 5.2=E2=80=9D. The issue is that GPT-5.=
2 is not one model, it is many, from the very weak GPT-5.2 mini to the very=
 good GPT-5.2 Thinking to the extremely powerful GPT-5.2 Pro. When you sele=
ct GPT-5.2, what you are really getting is =E2=80=9Cauto=E2=80=9D mode, whe=
re the AI decides which model to use, often a less powerful one. By paying,=
 you get to decide which model to use, and, to further complicate things, y=
ou can also select how hard the model =E2=80=9Cthinks=E2=80=9D about the an=
swer. For anything complex, I always manually select GPT-5.2 Thinking Exten=
ded (on the $20 plan) or GPT-5.2 Thinking Heavy (on more expensive plans). =
For a really hard problem that requires a lot of thinking, you can pick GPT=
-5.2 Pro, the strongest model, which is only available at a higher cost tie=
r.
For Gemini, there are three options: Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Thinking, and=
, for some paid plans, 3 Pro. If you pay for the Ultra plan, you get access=
 to Gemini Deep Think for very hard problems (which is in another menu enti=
rely). Always pick Gemini 3 Pro or Thinking for any serious problem. For Cl=
aude, you need to pick Opus 4.6 (though the new Sonnet 4.6 is also powerful=
, it is not quite as good) and turn on the =E2=80=9Cextended thinking=E2=80=
=9D switch.
Again, for most people, the model differences are now small enough that the=
 app and harness matter more than the model. Which brings us to the bigger =
question.
The Chatbot Interfaces
The vast majority of people use chatbots, the main websites or mobile apps =
of ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, to access their AI models. In fact, we can =
call the chatbot the most important and widespread AI app. In the past few =
months, these apps have become quite different from each other.
Some of the differences are which features are bundled with AI:
Bundled into the Gemini chatbot (and accessible with the little plus button=
): you can access nano banana (the best current AI image creation tool), Ve=
o 3.1 (a leading AI video creation tool), Guided Learning (when trying to s=
tudy, this helps the AI act more like a tutor), and Deep Research
Bundled into ChatGPT is even more of a hodgepodge of options accessible wit=
h the plus button. You can Create Images (the image generator is almost as =
good as nano banana, but you can=E2=80=99t access the Sora video creator th=
rough the chatbot), Study and Learn (the equivalent to Guided Learning in G=
emini, but there is also a separate Quizzes creator for some reason), Deep =
Research and Shopping Research (surprisingly good and overlooked), and a se=
t of other options that most people will not use often, so I won=E2=80=99t =
cover here.
Claude has only Deep Research as bundled option, but you can access a study=
 mode by creating a Project and selecting study project.=20
All of the AI models let you connect to data, such as letting the AI read y=
our email and calendar, access your files, or connect to other applications=
=2E This can make AI far more useful, b=
ut, again, each AI tool has a differen=
t set of connectors you can use.
These are confusing! For most people doing real work, the most important ad=
ditional feature is Deep Research and connecting AI to your content, but yo=
u may want to experiment with the others. Increasingly, however, what matte=
rs is the harness - the tools the AI has access to. And here, OpenAI and An=
thropic have clear leads over Google. Both Claude.ai and ChatGPT have the a=
bility to write and execute code, give you files, do extensive research, an=
d a lot more.  Google=E2=80=99s Gemini website is much less capable (even t=
hough its AI model is just as good),
As you can see, asking a similar question gets working spreadsheets and Pow=
erPoints from ChatGPT and Claude, along with clear citations I can follow u=
p on. Gemini, however, is unable to produce either kind of document, and it=
 does not provide citations or research. I do expect that Google will catch=
 up here soon, however.
One final note on Chatbots. GPT-5.2 Pro, with the harness that comes with i=
t, is a VERY smart model. It is the model that just helped derive a novel r=
esult in physics [ https://substack.com/redirect/569efa97-4f76-4fd9-954e-9f=
ba58c8e982?j=3DeyJ1IjoiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujHigXfWySh5Pw-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7mo2=
IM ] and it is the one I find most capable of doing complex statistical and=
 analytical work. It is only accessible through more expensive plans. Googl=
e Gemini 3 Deep Think also seems very capable, but suffers from the same ha=
rness problem.
Other apps and harnesses
The chatbot websites are where most people interact with AI, but they are i=
ncreasingly not where the most impressive work gets done. A growing set of =
other apps wrap these same models in more powerful harnesses, and they matt=
er.
Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Google Antigravity are the most well-develop=
ed of these, and they are all aimed at coders. Each of them gives an AI mod=
el access to your codebase, a terminal, and the ability to write, run, and =
test code on its own. You describe what you want built and the AI goes and =
builds it, coming back when it=E2=80=99s done or stuck. If you write code f=
or a living, these tools are changing your job. Because they have the most =
extensive harnesses, even if you don=E2=80=99t code, they can still do a tr=
emendous amount.
For example, a couple years ago, I became interested in how you would make =
an entirely paper-based LLM by providing all of the original GPT-1=E2=80=99=
s internal weights and parameters (the code of the AI, listed as 117 millio=
n numbers) in a set of books. In theory, with enough time, you could use th=
ose numbers to do the math of an AI by hand. This seemed like a fun idea, b=
ut obviously not worth doing. A week ago, I asked Claude Code to just do it=
 for me. Over the course of an hour or so (mostly the AI working, with a co=
uple suggestions), it made 80 beautifully laid out volumes containing all o=
f GPT-1, along with a guide to the math. It also came up with, and executed=
, covers for each volume that visualized the interior weights. It then put =
together a very elegant website (including the animation below), hooked it =
up to Stripe for payment and Lulu to print on demand, tested the whole thin=
g, and launched it for me. I never touched or looked at any code. I had it =
make 20 books available at cost to see what happened - and sold out the sam=
e day. All of the volumes are still available as free PDFs on the site [ ht=
tps://substack.com/redirect/74ec0416-2661-4b0a-88f1-ef94d8391f59?j=3DeyJ1Ij=
oiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujHigXfWySh5Pw-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7mo2IM ]. Now, I can have=
 a little project idea that would have required a lot of work, and just hav=
e it executed for me with very little effort on my part.=20
But the coding harnesses remain risky for amateurs and, obviously, focused =
on coding. New apps and harnesses are starting to focus on other types of k=
nowledge work.
Claude for Excel and Powerpoint are examples of specific harnesses inside o=
f applications. Both of them provide very impressive extensions to these pr=
ograms. Claude for Excel, in particular, feels like a massive change in wor=
king with spreadsheets, with the potential for a similar impact to Claude C=
ode for those who work with Excel for a living - you can, increasingly, tel=
l the AI what you want to do and it acts a sort of junior analyst and does =
the work. Because the results are in Excel, they are easy to check. Google =
has some integration with Google Sheets (but not as deeply) and OpenAI does=
 not really have an equivalent product.
Claude Cowork [ https://substack.com/redirect/42b8f7df-8784-4ea6-8985-62929=
52737a9?j=3DeyJ1IjoiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujHigXfWySh5Pw-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7mo2IM =
] is something genuinely new, and it deserves its own category. Released by=
 Anthropic in January, Cowork is essentially Claude Code for non-technical =
work. It runs on your desktop and can work directly with your local files a=
nd your browser. However, it is much more secure than Claude Code and less =
dangerous for non-technical users (it runs in a VM with default-deny networ=

PDFs into a spreadsheet, draft a summary) and Claude makes a plan, breaks i=
t into subtasks, and executes them on your computer while you watch (or don=
=E2=80=99t). It was built on the same agentic architecture as Claude Code, =
and was itself largely built by Claude Code in about two weeks. Neither Ope=
nAI or Google have a direct equivalent, at least this week. Cowork is still=
 a research preview, meaning it=E2=80=99s early and will eat through your u=
sage limits fast, but it is a clear sign of where all of this is heading: A=
I that doesn=E2=80=99t just talk to you about your work, but does your work=

NotebookLM [ https://substack.com/redirect/ca3e4e87-790e-45ec-aac3-1f1a6ae4=

s Google=E2=80=99s answer to a different problem: how do you use AI to make=
 sense of a lot of information? You can ask NotebookLM to do its own deep r=
esearch, or else add in your own papers, YouTube videos, websites, or files=
, and NotebookLM builds an interactive knowledge base you can query, turn i=
nto slides, mind maps, videos and, most famously, AI-generated podcasts whe=
re two hosts discuss your material (you can even interrupt the hosts to ask=
 questions). If you are a student, a researcher, or anyone who regularly ne=
eds to make sense of a pile of documents, NotebookLM is a very useful tool.=
=2E
And then there is OpenClaw, which I want to mention even though it doesn=E2=
=80=99t fit neatly into any of these categories and which you almost defini=
tely shouldn=E2=80=99t use. OpenClaw is an open-source AI agent that went v=
iral in late January. It runs locally on your computer, connects to whateve=
r AI model you want, and you talk to it like you were chatting with a perso=
n using standard chats like WhatsApp or iMessage. It can browse the web, ma=
nage your files, send emails, and run commands. It is sort of a 24/7 person=
al assistant that lives on your machine. It is also a serious security risk=
: you are giving an AI broad access to your computer and your accounts, and=
 no one knows exactly what dangers you are exposing yourself to. But it doe=
s serve as a sign of where things are going.
What to do now
I know this is a lot. Let me simplify.
If you are just getting started, pick one of the three systems (ChatGPT, Cl=
aude, or Gemini), pay the $20, and select the advanced model. The advice fr=
om my book still holds: invite AI to everything you do. Start using it for =
real work. Upload a document you=E2=80=99re actually working on. Give the A=
I a very complex task in the form of an RFP or SOP. [ https://substack.com/=
redirect/554b12cf-e239-4beb-8f9b-2dafbc226734?j=3DeyJ1IjoiZjh6YWkifQ.72eujH=
igXfWySh5Pw-3cmwzE5Ea6f_ojnL5QK7mo2IM ] Have a back-and-forth conversation =
and push it. This alone will teach you more than any guide.
If you are already comfortable with chatbots, try the specific apps. Notebo=
okLM is free and easy to use, which makes it a good starting place. If you =
want to go deeper, Anthropic offers the most powerful package in Claude Cod=
e, Claude Cowork (both accessible through Claude Desktop) as well as the sp=
ecialized PowerPoint and Excel Plugins. Give them a try. Again, not as a de=
mo, but with something you actually need done. Watch what it does. Steer it=
 when it goes wrong. You aren=E2=80=99t prompting, you are (as I wrote in m=
y last piece) managing.
The shift from chatbot to agent is the most important change in how people =
use AI since ChatGPT launched. It is still early, and these tools are still=
 hard to figure out and will still do baffling things. But an AI that does =
things is fundamentally more useful than an AI that says things, and learni=
ng to use it that way is worth your time.

tGPT came out, but this version represents a very large break with the past=

ntil a few months ago, for the vast majority of people, &#8220;using AI&#82=

he past few months, it has become practical to use AI as an agent: you can =
assign them to a task and they do them, using tools as appropriate. Because=
 of this change, you have to consider three things when deciding what AI to=

Claude 4.6 Opus do web searches and write code but also has instructions ab=
out how to approach various problems like creating spreadsheets or doing gr=

 Claude 4.6 Opus a virtual computer, a web browser, a code terminal, and th=
e ability to string these together to actually do stuff like researching, b=
uilding, and testing your new website from scratch. Manus (recently acquire=

pay at least $20 a month (though some areas of the world have alternate pla=

the paid models, but they are not. The free models are all optimized for ch=
at, rather than accuracy, so they are very fast and often more fun to talk =

se shortly), including phone apps or websites, </span><strong>the single mo=

 the AI companies do not make easy. If you are just chatting, the default m=

matter whether you use the free or pay version, the default model you are g=
iven is &#8220;ChatGPT 5.2&#8221;. The issue is that GPT-5.2 is not one mod=
el, it is many, from the very weak GPT-5.2 mini to the very good GPT-5.2 Th=
inking to the extremely powerful GPT-5.2 Pro. When you select GPT-5.2, what=
 you are really getting is &#8220;auto&#8221; mode, where the AI decides wh=
ich model to use, often a less powerful one. By paying, you get to decide w=
hich model to use, and, to further complicate things, you can also select h=
ow hard the model &#8220;thinks&#8221; about the answer. For anything compl=
ex, I always manually select </span><strong>GPT-5.2 Thinking Extended</stro=
ng><span> (on the $20 plan) or </span><strong>GPT-5.2 Thinking Heavy</stron=

 fact, we can call the chatbot the most important and widespread AI app. In=
 the past few months, these apps have become quite different from each othe=

ost important additional feature is Deep Research and connecting AI to your=
 content, but you may want to experiment with the others. Increasingly, how=
ever, what matters is the harness - the tools the AI has access to. And her=
e, OpenAI and Anthropic have clear leads over Google. Both Claude.ai and Ch=
